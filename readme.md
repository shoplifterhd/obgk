# obgk
osu background and video killer for linux
![obgk doing its thing](example.png)

# this will delete every picture and video if you dont put your songs directory!!!!!

# why???????
osu backgrounds are weird, and videos take up alot of space

# how to use???
go to the folder where obgk is, and do ./obgk.
if you get a permision denied error, do chmod +x obgk
you can also install this to /usr/bin or ./local/bin for convenience
